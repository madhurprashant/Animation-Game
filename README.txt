This design has changed from the previous homework.

The model, the movement class especially, was made to be more accessible.

The textual view essentially outputs a proper toString, which has been made to fit specifications.


The SVGView loops through all of the shapes, and then through each of their motions,
rendering them into string through what is essentially a big for loops.
It looks like this. For every shape, print into SVG then take all motions of that shape,
and print into SVG format.
The finished product should be visible on a website.

The visual view uses swing to get an output, and it essentially takes in all motions and shapes
and turns it into a series of commands that the animation has to do.
